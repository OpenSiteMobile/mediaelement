MobileSiteOS' HTML5 Media Player demo, as adapted from MediaElement and MediaElementPlayer

This repository contains our demo pages and configuration for utilizing the MobileSiteOS version of MediaElement and MediaElementPlayer, by John Dyer (http://mediaelementjs.com/). The orginal working files can be found at https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/. The MobileSiteOS files are a highly modified derivation of MediaElementPlayer.js. The original MediaElementPlayer.js script and CSS has been broken up into many individual modules that are loaded on an "as needed" basis by MobileSiteOS.

It should be noted that this is NOT a direct replacement for the original MediaElementPlayer, since it is entirely dependent on MobileSiteOS. And it is also a more experimental, "mobile focused" version (lacks IE7, 8, 9 support), which is not necessarily quite ready for a production application. It does however incorporated our version of FitMedia.j for negociating different display sizes, similar to the way the FitImage (https://github.com/kpobococ/FitImage/blob/master/Source/FitImage.js) script does for images presented in a responsive web design website.
